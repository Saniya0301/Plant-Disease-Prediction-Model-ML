# Plant-Disease-Prediction-Model-ML
# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model for detecting plant diseases. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify plant leaf images into one of 39 disease categories.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset is structured into three directories:

- Each folder contains 39 subfolders, one for each class (plant disease).
- Images are resized to **160x160 pixels** and loaded in batches.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model Type**: CNN-based image classifier
- **Image Size**: 160 × 160
- **Batch Size**: 32

### 🔢 Classes
There are **39 plant disease categories**, for example:

- Apple Scab
- Tomato Early Blight
- Potato Late Blight
- Corn Leaf Spot  
*(and more)*

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Load Dataset** using `image_dataset_from_directory`
2. **Preprocess Images** (resize, normalize)
3. **Build CNN Model** with Keras
4. **Train Model** using training and validation datasets
5. **Evaluate** on test data
